# This is the old synthesis system.

It's not updated anymore, but it's here for the HTTP websites which can't use AudioWorklets.
To use this system, change the `synthesisMode` to `"legacy"`:

```js
synth.synthesisMode = 'legacy'
```

it should automatically create the legacy channels.
If you want to automatically use this mode, then

```js
export const DEFAULT_SYNTHESIS_MODE = 'legacy'
```

Note:
the synth will try to detect if the worklets are available. if not, then it should switch to legacy
